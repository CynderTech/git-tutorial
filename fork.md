#### 1. Fork Donal's repo on GitHub

Use the GitHub interface to fork
https://github.com/donal/jsconf-asia-2014-git-and-github-workshop to your
GitHub account.

#### 2. Clone your new repo to your computer

From the command line:
```
git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/jsconf-asia-2014-git-and-github-workshop.git
```

Now you have a working copy of the repository.

*Donal says*: I always use the `git@` (= SSH) protocol for any repo I own. I
find it easier to set up an SSH key than manage username/password.

By the way, never use the `git://` protocol. It doesn't have authentication
(and isn't supported in GitHub anyway).
